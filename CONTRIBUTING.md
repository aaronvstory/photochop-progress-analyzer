## 🐛 Debugging

### Common Development Issues

**Import Errors**:
```bash
# Ensure you're in the src/ directory
cd src/
python photoshop_monitor.py
```

**Permission Issues**:
- On Windows, run Command Prompt as Administrator
- On Unix, check file permissions with `ls -la`

**Path Issues**:
- Use absolute paths during development
- Test with various folder structures
- Verify cross-platform path handling

### Debugging Tools
- Use `print()` statements for quick debugging
- Add `--debug` flag for verbose output (future feature)
- Check `photoshop_progress_log.json` for runtime data

## 📊 Performance Considerations

### Optimization Areas
- Folder scanning speed for large directories
- Memory usage with extensive folder structures
- CPU usage during continuous monitoring
- File I/O operations

### Benchmarking
Test with these scenarios:
- 10 folders, 100 files each
- 100 folders, 50 files each
- 1000 folders, 10 files each
- Mixed folder sizes and structures

## 🔐 Security Guidelines

### What NOT to Include
- Personal file paths
- User credentials
- API keys or tokens
- System-specific configurations

### Best Practices
- Use environment variables for sensitive data
- Validate all user inputs
- Handle file permissions gracefully
- Follow principle of least privilege
